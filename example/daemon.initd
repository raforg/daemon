# This is an example /etc/init.d script that shows how to use daemon(1)
# in that context. Note that this would need to be modified quite a bit
# to meet the usual conventions of any specific system but if you aren't
# concerned about that it should be usable. At least it's a starting point.

# The daemon's name (to ensure uniqueness and for stop, restart and status)
name="EXAMPLE"
# The path of the client executable
command="/usr/bin/EXAMPLE"
# Any command line arguments for the client executable
command_args=""
# The path of the daemon executable
daemon="/usr/bin/daemon"

[ -x "$daemon" ] || exit 0
[ -x "$command" ] || exit 0

# Note: The following daemon option arguments could be in /etc/daemon.conf
# instead. That would probably be better because if the command itself were
# there as well then we could just use the name here to start the daemon.
# Here's some code to do it here in case you prefer that.

# Any command line arguments for the daemon executable (when starting)
daemon_start_args="" # e.g. --inherit --env="ENV=VAR" --unsafe
# The pidfile directory (need to force this so status works for normal users)
pidfiles="/var/run"
# The user[:group] to run as (if not to be run as root)
user=""
# The path to chroot to (otherwise /)
chroot=""
# The path to chdir to (otherwise /)
chdir=""
# The umask to adopt, if any
umask=""
# The syslog facility or filename for the client's stdout (otherwise discarded)
stdout="daemon.info"
# The syslog facility or filename for the client's stderr (otherwise discarded)
stderr="daemon.err"
