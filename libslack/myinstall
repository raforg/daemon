# This is a local version of install for OpenSolaris because it doesn't have
# /usr/ucb/install and the normal Solaris install program is weird and
# doesn't do what its manpage says it does (i.e. it ignores the directory 
# at the end of the command line instead of installing the file there).

# Note: All our uses of install are of the form:
#   install -m ### file... dir
# or:
#   install -m ### file dest
