daemon - turns other processes into daemons

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~
Daemon turns other processes into daemons. There are many tasks that need to
be performed to correctly set up a daemon process. This can be tedious.
Daemon performs these tasks for other processes. This is useful for writing
daemons in languages other than C, C++ or Perl (e.g. /bin/sh, Java).

If you want to write daemons in languages that can link against C functions
(e.g. C, C++), see libslack which contains the core functionality of daemon.

DETAILS
~~~~~~~
Daemon turns other processes into daemons. There are many tasks that need to
be performed to correctly set up a daemon process. This can be tedious.
Daemon performs these tasks for other processes.

The preparatory tasks that daemon performs for other processes are:

First revoke any setuid or setgid privileges that daemon may have been
installed with (by system administrators who laugh in the face of danger).

Process command line options.

Change the root directory if the --chroot option was supplied.

Change the process uid and gid if the --user option was supplied. Only
root can use this option. Note that the uid of daemon itself is changed,
rather than just changing the uid of the client process.

Read the configuration file (/etc/daemon.conf by default, or specified
by the --config option). Note: The root directory and the user must be
set before access to the configuration file can be attempted so neither
--chroot nor --user options may appear in the configuration file.

Disable core file generation to prevent security holes in daemons run by
root (unless the --core option is supplied).

Become a daemon process:

o If daemon was not invoked by init(8) or inetd(8):

  o Background the process to lose process group leadership.

  o Start a new process session.

  o Under SVR4, background the process again to lose process session
    leadership. This prevents the process from ever gaining a controlling
    terminal. This only happens when SVR4 is defined and
    NO_EXTRA_SVR4_FORK is not defined when libslack is compiled.
    Before doing this, ignore SIGHUP because when the session leader
    terminates, all processes in the foreground process group are sent a
    SIGHUP signal. Note that this code may not execute (e.g. when started
    by init(8) or inetd(8) or when either SVR4 was not defined or
    NO_EXTRA_SVR4_FORK was defined when libslack was compiled). This
    means that the client can't make any assumptions about the SIGHUP
    handler when daemon_init() returns.

o Change directory to the root directory so as not to hamper umounts.

o Clear the umask to enable explicit file creation modes.

o Close all open file descriptors. If daemon was invoked by inetd(8)
  stdin, stdout and stderr are left open since they are open to a
  socket.

o Open stdin, stdout and stderr to /dev/null in case something
  requires them to be open. Of course, this is not done if daemon was
  invoked by inetd(8).

o If the --name option is supplied, create and lock a file containing the
  process id of the daemon process. The presence of this locked file
  prevents two instances of a daemon with the same name from running at the
  same time.  The default location of the pidfile is /var/run for root or
  /tmp for ordinary users.

If the --umask option was supplied, set the umask to its argument.
Otherwise, set the umask to 022 to prevent accidentally creating group or
world writable files.

Set the current directory if the --chdir option was supplied.

Daemon then spawns the client command specified on its command line and
waits for it to terminate.

If the --syslog, --outlog and/or --errlog option were supplied, the client's
standard output and/or standard error are captured by daemon and sent to the
respective syslog destinations.

When the client terminates, daemon respawns it if the --respawn option is
supplied and the client terminated successfully after at least 600 seconds.
Otherwise daemon terminates.

If daemon receives a SIGTERM signal, it propagates the signal to the client
and then terminates.

Note: For security reasons, never install daemon with setuid or setgid
privileges. It is unnecessary. If you do, daemon will revert to the real
user and group for safety before doing anything else.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
This version is only known to work on the following systems:

    Linux 2.6 (i386, x86_64, debian-5.0.4, ubuntu-10.04, fedora-13)
    Solaris 10 10/09 (i386, amd64)
    OpenSolaris 2009/06 (i386, amd64)
    OpenBSD 4.7 (i386, amd64)
    FreeBSD 8.0 (i386, amd64)
    NetBSD 5.0.2 (i386, amd64)
    MacOSX 10.{4,5,6} (i386, x86_64, ppc)
    kFreeBSD 20090729 (i386)

For these systems, just run the "config" script in the source directory. It
will run the appropriate script in the "conf" directory for the current host.

Note: There isn't a real configure script so you will no doubt encounter
problems on other systems. An ISO C and POSIX/XPG4 environment will help
greatly. If your system doesn't have snprintf(3), GNU getopt_long(3),
vsscanf(3), strcasecmp(3), strncasecmp(3), strlcpy(3) or strlcat(3),
uncomment the relevant lines in the libslack/config.h file to include them
in libslack.

If your system doesn't have POSIX 1003.2 compliant regex functions, or they
are buggy, either: install the GNU implementation,
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/regex/regex-0.12.tar.gz [290K]
(doesn't support internationalisation);
or install Henry Spencer's implementation,
ftp://ftp.zoo.toronto.edu/pub/regex.shar [157K].

If you really, really, really don't want the regular expression functions,
uncomment HAVE_REGEX_H in libslack/config.h to enable the rest of the str
module to be compiled.

If you have a linux-2.2.x system, you must have LinuxThreads-0.8 or
LinuxThreads-0.9 and the latest corresponding version of glibc.
If you have a linux-2.4.x system, you must have at least glibc-2.2.1
and glibc-linuxthreads-2.2.1. They are available from
http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/glibc/. Older versions can be used but
they have some very nasty bugs.

First, uninstall any previous version:

    cd /usr/local/src/daemon-0.6.3
    make uninstall

To build and test:

    tar xzf daemon-0.6.4.tar.gz
    cd daemon-0.6.4
    ./config          # iff linux, solaris, openbsd, freebsd, netbsd or macosx
    make              # must be gnu make
    make test         # only tests libslack. to test daemon, see test/README

To install daemon and its manpage (in /usr/local by default):

    make install

To install into somewhere other than /usr/local:

    make PREFIX=/opt/daemon install

To install an empty /etc/daemon.conf file:

    make install-daemon-conf

To uninstall daemon:

    make uninstall

To install libslack and its manpages (into /usr/local by default):

    make install-slack

To uninstall libslack:

    make uninstall-slack

For more details:

    make help

The manpage for daemon is daemon(1). There is one manpage for each module in
libslack (as well as a symlink for each function). The module manpages are
agent(3), coproc(3), daemon(3), err(3), fio(3), hsort(3), lim(3), link(3),
list(3), locker(3), map(3), mem(3), msg(3), net(3), prog(3), prop(3),
pseudo(3), sig(3) and str(3). If necessary, the manpages getopt(3),
snprintf(3) and vsscanf(3) are created as well.

BINARY PACKAGES

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires GNU make to compile.
Requires perl to run the scripts in the conf directory.
Requires perl to install per-function manpage links.
Requires an ISO C compiler like gcc to compile the source.
Requires pod2man (comes with perl) to make the manpages.
Requires pod2html (comes with perl) to make the html manpages.
Requires POSIX 1003.2 compliant regex functions. See INSTALL.
Requires libpthread. See INSTALL.

PLATFORM NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These platform notes are quite old and probably mostly irrelevant.

Linux
~~~~~
Linux 2.2 always returns 0.0.0.0 on getsockopt(IP_MULTICAST_IF) so
net_multicast_get_interface() always returns 0 under Linux 2.2. Linux 2.4
does not have this bug.

Make sure you have a recent glibc (at least 2.1.3) and libpthread (at least
0.8) (See INSTALL).

Linux 2.2 and 2.4 have a bug-like feature in poll(2). It always times out
10ms later than specified. Libslack corrects for this as best as it can (if
> 10ms -= 10ms) but it's not good enough when you need timers with a
granularity of 10ms. In this case, you have to use
agent_create_with_select() instead of agent_create() under Linux because
select() doesn't have this bug. However, scalable I/O is impossible with
select(). So, if you need timers with a granularity of 10ms *and* scalable
I/O, you need an agent that uses select() in one thread for the timers and
separate agents that use poll() in other threads for the I/O.

Solaris
~~~~~~~
Solaris (at least 2.6 and 2.7) doesn't return the hardware address or index
of network interfaces from ioctl() with a SIOCGIFINDEX command argument.
Libslack fills in the index in net_interfaces().

UNIX domain datagram sockets aren't supported very nicely. An actual
filesystem entry is needed for the client and it must be unlinked after use.
It's also possible for a malicious local user to deny a client access to the
server. The solution is to always use UNIX domain stream sockets.

Solaris has an inadequate snprintf() function so libslack provides it's own
implementation. When configured for Solaris, this snprintf() function will
format exactly like the system's sprintf() function, even though it has
incorrect behaviour with respect to the ISO C standard. I thought this was
better than having thousands of module tests apparently "fail".

OpenBSD
~~~~~~~
Has the same UNIX domain datagram socket problem as Solaris.

FreeBSD
~~~~~~~
Has the same UNIX domain datagram socket problem as Solaris.
Can't lock fifos so fifo_open() can't guarantee a unique reader.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~
Probably has the same UNIX domain datagram problem as Solaris.

MAILING LISTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you'd like to be kept up to date with daemon releases or have questions
or suggestions, you can join one or more of the following (extremely low
volume) mailing lists (@libslack.org).

    daemon-announce (Announcements)
    daemon-users    (User forum)
    daemon-dev      (Development forum)

To subscribe to any of these mailing lists, send a mail message to
<listname>-request@libslack.org with "subscribe" as the message body.

E.g. 

    $ echo subscribe | mail daemon-announce-request@libslack.org
    $ echo subscribe | mail daemon-users-request@libslack.org
    $ echo subscribe | mail daemon-dev-request@libslack.org

Or you can send a mail message to majordomo@libslack.org with subscribe
listname in the message body. This way, you can include multiple subscribe
commands to subscribe to multiple lists at the same time. 

E.g. 

    $ mail majordomo@libslack.org
    subscribe daemon-announce
    subscribe daemon-users
    subscribe daemon-dev
    .

A digest version of each mailing list is also available. Subscribe to
digests as above but append -digest to the listname.

E.g. 

    $ echo subscribe | mail daemon-announce-digest-request@libslack.org
    $ echo subscribe | mail daemon-users-digest-request@libslack.org
    $ echo subscribe | mail daemon-dev-digest-request@libslack.org

Or 

    $ mail majordomo@libslack.org
    subscribe daemon-announce-digest
    subscribe daemon-users-digest
    subscribe daemon-dev-digest

Note that these are all extremely low volume mailing lists so there's not
much use for the digest lists.
